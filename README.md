# Beer
Here I built an express application that would allow users to type in a alcoholic beverage, once they click submit they will view a page that displays content information the user on the type of drink he or she has searched. 


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
*Express
*JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
I increased my knowledge on using the Express wireframe and better unnderstanding on how to code with vanila Javascript .
